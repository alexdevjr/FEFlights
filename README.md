# TSFlightsApp

This is the final app. ( branch: step9e )

RUNNING THIS APP ON STACKBLITZ:

Everything should just work on StackBlitz. The backend is hosted on Heroku which means that the back end application will go to sleep if it hasn't been used within the past hour.  This means you will have to wait for the flights to load if your'e the first one to visit in a while. It should take 15 seconds or less. 


RUNNING THIS APP LOCALLY: 

For this app to work locally on your computer, it requires a back end running on port 3002

Back end repo is here: 


Also, you should use the Chrome web broswer with the CORS plugin: 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en

Installing the CORS plugin above will allow your front end and back end to talk to each other without being blocked for security reasons.
